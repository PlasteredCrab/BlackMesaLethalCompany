# FAQ
Q: When is the full release going to be?

A: Now! After 350+ hours into this project I think it is finally ready for a full release! I will be adding more as time goes on, but it is out of beta now :)

Q: Can monsters crawl through the vents?

A: Yes! They all can go through the ventilation ducts like any other flooring, but eventually I would like to restrict it to not let Brackens, Coilheads, Nutcrackers, and Masked to go through them.

Q: The performance is bad sometimes without Cullfactory, are you going to fix that?

A: These assets are game rips from Black Mesa so they are far more detailed than Lethal Company base assets and I have done what I can to optimize it. To help with performance I highly recommend CullFactory and PathfindingLagFix to play with this as it helps with it a lot for now.

# Known issues that are being actively worked on
- some desync issues with light switches
- Sometimes Fire Exits on the moon surface cannot find their interior counterpart + sometimes only 2 interior Fire Exits spawn when there are 3 exterior Fire Exits leading to warping to wrong Exit
- no random props per tile yet (I am saving global props for last since prop dressing over 100+ tiles will take forever lol)

# Tips for most fun
- Bring as big of a group as you can
- Have someone stay in the security room
- bring lots of flashlights and walkies
- Try to remember the path you take as it is easy to get lost >:)

# Planned Features
- More functional Light switches for rooms
- More shortcuts for the larger tiles
- Charging suit stations for health (Health station will fill up to 1 players health)
- Custom Scrap based on Half Life
- Custom Sound FX and Ambient noises
- Steam Vents
- Resonance Cascade Lightning Storms
- Alien hazards like Barnacles on ceilings and Half Life turrets and tripmine lasers
- Emergency Doors (operatable by the ship console)
- More room tiles >:)
