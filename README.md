# FAQ
Q: When is the full release going to be?

A: I am not sure when it will get to the state where I deem it "complete" as I am a perfectionist sometimes and I have already sank 200+ hours into this project and in my head there is still a lot I want to add so it is hard to give an estimate

Q: Can monsters crawl through the vents?

A: Yes! They all can go through the ventilation ducts like any other flooring, but eventually I would like to restrict it to not let Brackens, Coilheads, Nutcrackers, and Masked to go through them.

Q: It is very dark, are you going to add more lights?

A: Yeah lighting take forever so it is something I am actively working on, as well as adding fucntional light switches to the rooms

Q: The performance is bad sometimes without Cullfactory, are you going to fix that?

A: Yeah this is my first time making anything in Unity, let alone a mod for lethal company so I have a lot of optimizations to do still. To help with performance I highly recommend CullFactory and PathfindingLagFix to play with this as it helps with it a lot for now.

# Known issues that are being actively worked on
- Lots of lighting issues on faces/surfaces of objects/rooms
- No hazards like turrets/landmines on custom moon due to issues with spawns for them
- some desync issues with vent doors and doors in general sometimes (looking into this is top priority)
- secret vent area has some minor collision issues that I will fix next update
- Sometimes Fire Exits on the moon surface cannot find their interior counterpart + sometimes only 2 interior Fire Exits spawn when there are 3 exterior Fire Exits leading to warping to wrong Exit
- no random props per tile yet (I am saving global props for last since prop dressing over 100+ tiles will take forever lol)

# Tips for most fun
- Bring as big of a group as you can
- bring lots of flashlights and walkies
- Try to remember the path you take as it is easy to get lost >:)

# Planned Features
- More functional Light switches for rooms
- Functioning Resonance Cascade chamber with the apparatus powering it (will turn off all power to the facility)
- More shortcuts for the larger tiles
- Charging suit stations for health (Health station will fill up to 1 players health)
- Custom Scrap based on Half Life
- Custom Sound FX and Ambient noises
- Steam Vents
- Emergency Doors (operatable by the ship console)
- More room tiles >:)
