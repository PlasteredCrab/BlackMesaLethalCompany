# FAQ
Q: Can monsters crawl through the vents?

A: Yes! They all can go through the ventilation ducts like any other flooring, but eventually I would like to restrict it to not let Brackens, Coilheads, Nutcrackers, and Masked to go through them.

Q: The performance is bad sometimes without Cullfactory, are you going to fix that?

A: These assets are game rips from Black Mesa so they are far more detailed than Lethal Company base assets and I have done what I can to optimize it. To help with performance I highly recommend CullFactory and PathfindingLagFix to play with this as it helps with it a lot for now.

# Known issues that are being actively worked on
- Inverse Teleporter sending players above rooms and in walls (this is due to the NavMesh being in those places so I am actively trying to make this not happen anymore)
- sometimes custom enemies that come with the facility spawn in walls or on ceilings due to navMesh as well (also being looked at)
- some desync issues with light switches
- no random props per tile yet (I am saving global props for last since prop dressing over 100+ tiles will take forever lol)
- still some fps issues on low end machines (still working on doing more to optimize)


# Planned Features
- Randomized Parkour elements that can show up in rooms
- New Hazards unique to Black Mesa
- More shortcuts for the larger tiles
- Custom Scrap based on Half Life
- Custom Sound FX and Ambient noises
- Steam Vents
- Resonance Cascade Lightning Storms
- Alien hazards like Barnacles on ceilings and Half Life turrets and tripmine lasers
- Emergency Doors (operatable by the ship console)
- More room tiles >:)
